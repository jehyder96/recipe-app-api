Recipe API project

Built a virtual recipe book recipe API that allows a user to upload and store some of their favorite recipes alongside with photos.

The API features titles with price points, cooking times, ingredients, cooking tags, etc.

The API handles creating and updating user profiles, changing passwords, creating objects, uploading images, filtering and searching objects, and more.
